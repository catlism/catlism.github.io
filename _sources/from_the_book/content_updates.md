Needless to say, the *digital* moves fast: as such contents included in the book - last revised between February and November 2022 - may have become obsolete, or new details may have emerged. Hence this page collects links to online materials - along with a short description for each one - that provide updates to topics discussed in the book.  
Topics are listed alphabetically, and updates are organised in inverse chronological order (elements at the top of each topic are the newest ones); each link leads to a preservation copy of the original page, and is accompanied by the date on which the article was published. Sidenotes include the page number(s) where the topic is discussed.
