# Git 101: the basics[^sn1]

As one of the "most widely adopted distributed open source solution for keeping track of changes to files [...] `git` works by creating an environment that retains details of each change made to the fles being tracked, allowing one or more users to have a complete log of the edits made to the data throughout time by the
users acting upon it."[^sn2]. Installation files and instructions can be found on `git` [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) {cite:p}`chacon_pro_2022` respectively.  
Figure 4.4 graphically summarises the basic operations, exemplified through the actual commands further below.
