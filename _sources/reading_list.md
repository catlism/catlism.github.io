# *Digital technicalities*: a reading list
Following is a curated list of online resources related to *digital technicalities*, ranging from computational linguistics to AI, from philosophy of science to retrogaming, from digital humanities to cybersecurity, and more.
The list is constantly updated and includes both the original link and a preservation link (through the Wayback Machine) to each resource. It also contains the publishing date of the resource (automatically retrieved, or set to "unknown" if the scraper fails to extract it from the HTML source) and the date the resource was added to the list.
The majority of the resources are selected from two aggregators, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and [/.Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/).
Some materials may be behind a paywall (and the archived copy may consequently be unavailable); in such cases you may try using the browser extension `Bypass Paywalls Clean` available for both [Firefox](https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean/) and [Chrome](https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean).
