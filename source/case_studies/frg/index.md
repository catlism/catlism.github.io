# Analysing the language of far-right groups on Twitter and Facebook

> The case study [utilised] in this section is based on the research conducted at Swansea University Department of Applied Linguistics under the supervision of Prof. Nuria Lorenzo-Dus, as part of the project â€˜Developing Interdisciplinary and Industry Collaboration to Tackle Far-Right Extremist Use of Social Media for Propaganda and Recruitmentâ€™ (Principal Investigator Dr. Lella Nouri). Outputs from the research are published in {cite:p}`nouri_investigating_2019` and {cite:p}`lorenzo-dus_discourse_2021` , which served as the basis for the contents [described].[^sn1]

```{warning}
Similar to the tools and techiques described in [Twitter](../../data_collection/social_media_platforms/twitter/snscrape.md), as of late June 2023 a number of changes have made anonymous access to tweets impossible, and consequently rendering the use of the tool [`twint`](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) (a project abandoned in the spring of 2022) and the techniques exemplified below useless. They are included to support the contents of the book.

## Collecting Twitter data for the corpus
### Collecting Twitter data for the corpus using `twint`[^sn2]
```{code-block} bash
:name: c6-01
:caption: Command `[c6.01]` {octicon}`stop;1em;sd-text-danger`

twint -u Twitter â€“since 2015-06-16 -o twint_output.csv -csv
```

### Collecting Twitter data for the corpus using `snscrape`[^sn3]
```{code-block} bash
:name: c6-02
:caption: Command `[c6.02]` {octicon}`stop;1em;sd-text-danger`

snscrape -v --progress -jsonl twitter-search 'since:2015â€“06â€“16 from:Twitter' > snscrape_output.json
```

### Extract the data from `twint` output to XML format[^sn4]
```{rli} https://github.com/catlism/catlism_scripts/raw/main/s6.02_extract_twint_csv.py
:name: s6-02
:caption: Script `[s6.02]` [{octicon}`download;1em;sd-text-primary`](https://github.com/catlism/catlism_scripts/raw/main/s6.02_extract_twint_csv.py)
:linenos: 
:lines: 20-
```

### Example of data extracted with `[s6.02]`[^sn5]
```{code-block} xml
:name: e6-04
:caption: Example `[e6.04]` 
:linenos:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

## Collecting Wordpress blog data for the corpus

### Syntax used for the Wordpress blog pages[^sn6]
```{code-block} bash
:name: e6-05
:caption: Example `[e6.05]`

https://example.com/page/[N]/
```

### Collecting links to all the posts in a blog[^sn7]

> Script `[s6.03]` [uses] the module requests and BeautifulSoup [...] to crawl the blog pages containing links to the posts and to scrape each postâ€™s URL, respectively. The procedure relies on the default structure of WordPress blogs, whereby users can browse all the available posts in pages where only a preview is shown; these pages are accessible through links formatted as in example `[e6.05]`, where `[N]` is an incremental number starting from 2 indicating the second â€“ up to the *n*th â€“ page of the blog (the first page is instead missing the `/page/[N]/` string); and the string page indicates the URL path under which the contents are archived. Depending on how the creator of a blog sets up the website, strings such as `blog`, `news`, and `articles` may appear instead of `page`; in such cases it is sufficient to replace the latter with the relevant label in script `[s6.03]`. A further step is then required to adapt it to any other blog built using WordPress by changing the starting web address of the blog in lines 30 and 34.[^sn8]

```

## Transliterating emojis in the corpus [^sn9]

### Function to transliterate emojis (using two different output formats)
The function defined in `[s6.04]` can be imported into any script and be used with the included syntax

```{code-block} python
demojize(INPUT, OUTPUT_FORMAT)
```

```{rli} https://github.com/catlism/catlism_scripts/raw/main/s6.04_demojize.py
:name: s6-04
:caption: Script `[s6.04]` [{octicon}`download;1em;sd-text-primary`](https://github.com/catlism/catlism_scripts/raw/main/s6.04_demojize.py)
:linenos:
:lines: 20-
```

### Example of message before the transliteration

```{code-block} bash
:name: e6-06
:caption: Example `[e6.06]`

oh good youâ€™re up ðŸ˜„, here are a million Tweets to look at
```

### Example `[e6.06]` after emojis transliteration through `[s6.04]`

```{code-block} xml
:name: e6-07
:caption: Example `[e6.07]`

# using option 'default'
<text>oh good you're up {grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes}, here are a million Tweets to look at</text>

# using option 'custom'
<text>oh good you're up {grinning^face^with^smiling^eyes}, here are a million Tweets to look at</text>
