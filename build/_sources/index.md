This website serves as online compendium for the book [***Corpus Approaches to Language in Social Media***](https://www.routledge.com/Corpus-Approaches-to-Language-in-Social-Media/Cristofaro/p/book/9781032125701) (`CATLISM`; Di Cristofaro 2023) published in the series [*Routledge Advances in Corpus Linguistics*](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Advances-in-Corpus-Linguistics/book-series/SE0593)[^sn4].  

The focus of both this compendium and the book is the **collection, processing, and formatting of digital data from *social media*** (understood as "any digital content [that] provides the user with the ability to interact with it [...] through a unique uniform resource locator (URL)"[^sn3]) **for corpus purposes** (see also [](on_scripts.md)).  
The aim is

> proposing a ***broad view of corpus approaches*** able to include those notions and mechanisms ['*digital technicalities*] that – while not classically associated with natural language – are [...] i) foundational of the digital environments in which language production and exchanges occur and ii) at the core of the techniques that are used to produce, collect, and process the focus of investigation, that is, digital textual data.[^sn7]
  
As such this **online compendium contains**:  
  
:::{dropdown} 
{fas}`check;sd-text-success` the scripts included in the volume[^sn6] - downloadable and formatted using colour-coded syntax highlighting - aimed at [collecting](data_collection/index.md) and [processing](data_processing/index.md) data from webpages, blogs, fora, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube  
  
{fas}`check;sd-text-success` interactive videos documenting the use of the commands and tools employed throughout the volume  
  
{fas}`check;sd-text-success` further scripts and instructions for tools aimed at collecting data from platforms that, due to reasons of space, could not be included in the volume;
